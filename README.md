# Coding Test MCQs Reource
# Why ?
While doing project i encoutered a problem that there is no online API or database resource availble for coding test mcqs. So i had to scrap these mcqs my self. To save other from this hustle i am open sourcing these mcqs.

## About Respository
You can download these mcqs either in .JSON or .CSV files. There are currently over 800 MCQS. More will be added soon. All MCQs are scrapped from websites.

## Download
