1, What is xor linked list?,uses of bitwise XOR operation to decrease storage requirements for doubly linked lists,uses of bitwise XOR operation to decrease storage requirements for linked lists,uses of bitwise operations to decrease storage requirements for doubly linked lists,just another form of linked list,a
2, What does a xor linked list have?,every node stores the XOR of addresses of previous and next nodes,actuall memory address of next node,every node stores the XOR of addresses of previous and next two nodes,every node stores xor 0 and the current node address,a
3, What does first and last nodes of a xor linked lists contain ? (let address of first and last be A and B),NULL xor A and B xor NULL,NULL and NULL,A and B,NULL xor A and B,d
4, Which of the following is an advantage of XOR list?,"Almost of debugging tools cannot follow the XOR chain, making debugging difficult",You need to remember the address of the previously accessed node in order to calculate the next node’s address,In some contexts XOR of pointers is not defined,XOR list decreases the space requirement in doubly linked list,d
